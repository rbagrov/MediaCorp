As new company we at MediaCorp need to execute certain pipelines and we cannot afford the use an external scheduler.
We have decided that we need to build for our purposes simple scheduler that executes other functions with a configurable order and option for strict execution (if a job fails stop or continue).
We need to have tests that would ensure we did the right thing.
